<p>KeyTik come with 2 download version, normal version and source code version. Basically, normal version is KeyTik in '.exe' form and source code version is KeyTik in '.py' form. For more info about it, check out <a href="/introduction/safety/#download-options">KeyTik Download Version</a>. You need to install AutoHotkey and optionally Interception driver to make KeyTik works.
