<h2 id="how-is-keytik-work" tabindex="-1">How Is KeyTik Work <a class="anchor" href="#how-is-keytik-work">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>1. Multiple profile</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you need multiple condition to activate remap like for different game or you need to remap some key for only one condition and don't need to always activate it, you can make different profile as you need and activate or deactivate individually so you don't need to adjust your remap every single time you need it for another condition.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Always on top</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you playing game and that game didn't have change input function, you can make KeyTik window to always on top using &quot;Enable Always On Top&quot; button, so you can play the game, try the game input and change the input in KeyTik or try the remap profile on that game without go back and forth between game window and KeyTik window.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Store Profile</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you don't want to show profile in the main window but you still need it or you just want to store it for future, you can store the profile using &quot;Store&quot; button. If you happen want to run it, you can use &quot;Show Stored Profile&quot; and it will show your stored profile an if you want to show it back in main window, you can use &quot;Retrieve&quot; button to move it back to main window.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Run On Startup</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have damaged key on your keyboard and want to remap it permanently (You can still disable it so it's not entirely permanent) without activate it manually every single time you open your computer, you can use &quot;Startup&quot; button to make profile run on startup. If you do that, your profile will active every single time you open your computer. You can disable it using &quot;Unstart&quot; or disable it in task manager startup apps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Text Mode</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text mode is for more advance remapping. KeyTik using AutoHotkey as profile automation script language and text mode allow you to edit your script without opening  script editor. You can use this when you need to adjust your script or use it for automation like auto clicking etc. The reason for this feature is, so that you can use full potential of AutoHotkey and not limited to just remapping some key.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Import Profile</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can add AutoHotkey script from outside, like download script from someone or from some platform and use it as profile. It work with adding another command in your imported script so it can use functionality from KeyTik. I also made an open-source repository for AutoHotkey Script Collection and template that allow you to download already made AutoHotkey script. AutoHotkey Script Collection and template also give you guide on how to adjust the script to your preferences or using the script as script template. Click this &quot;<a href="https://github.com/Fajar-RahmadJaya/AutoHotkeyCollection">AutoHotkey Script Collection</a>&quot; if you are interested.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Pin Profile</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can pin your favorite profile or profile that you use the most so it can showed first in the profile list. You just need to click pin icon on the profile to make it work.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>8. Assign Script On Specific Device</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can connect 2 keyboard on your device. You can use first keyboard to typing normally and the other one to do automation tool such as auto clicker, screen clicker, multiple files opener and more, on each key and that would not affect the first keyboard. So you are left with 2 keyboard connected, 1 can do normal keyboard task and the other one can do automation tool. Even more, you can assign the automation tool to more compact keyboard such as mini keyboard, so each key in that keyboard can do different automation tool. This will make your desktop and keyboard more neat and flexible.</li>
<li>To do this, you just need to click on 'Select Device' button when you create or edit profile. When you do this, KeyTik will show list of device connected to your device. If you want to refresh the list, you just need to press 'Refresh' button. And if you not sure where is your device or where to select, you can use AutoHotkey Interception built in monitor to test your device. To do that, you can just check the checkbox on the Device ID and try to press keys on your device. If the Device ID is correct, the monitor will show the keys you press. After knowing your device ID, then you just need to select the ID from the 'Select Device Window'.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9. And Many More</strong>:</p>

<li>Above is just an example how you can use each feature. It's absolutely possible to use it for different need and case. There are a lot of possibility you can discover with KeyTik.
